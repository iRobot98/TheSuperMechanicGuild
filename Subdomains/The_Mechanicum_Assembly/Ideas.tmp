                - Guild Assembly makes/proposes/discusses laws/policies/procedures to implement,
                - After Guild Assembly and General Assembly agrees on final product/laws/policies/procedure, push to President/Executive to implement,
                - Executive Branch (President, Board, Ministerait), organises the implementaion of the agreed upon ideas,
                    - if under existing docket, restructures to execute,
                    - if need new docket, new docket is created,
                    - dockets are temporal; beginning date, role/goal, end date
                    - dockets are accountable; docket head answers to public/General Assembly for performance relative to goals, cyclic/periodic
                5. 3 arms, legislature, executive, and judicial system work on credibility and flat-democracy (roles are respected whilst individuals may change, and changing of rules/laws is procedural but open)
