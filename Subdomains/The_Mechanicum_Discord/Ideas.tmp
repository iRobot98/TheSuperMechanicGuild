Ideas:
    1. Twitter-Facebook-Discord merge:
        - Twitter:
            1. public speaking space everyone has unmediated access to;
            2. short messages (500 chars), with comments, retweets, screenshots, reactions;
                - memes, pics, vids
            3. able to be shared offsite (ie digital history)
            4. verification and honour system,
        - Facebook/Meta:
            1. Personal blog, with limited access control, friendships and groups
            2. Personal email and comm routes, 
            3. personal ecommerce shop,
            4. digital-verse platform/connection,
            - Snapchat:
                1. real life ID,
                2. Digital anonymous subaccounts are available,
                3. video sharing platform,
        - Discord:
            1. form groups and servers, decentralised organisation,
            2. organise independently and supervise internally,
            3. bots and API for automation and integration/extension

    2. Purpose:
        1. exchange ideas, discuss issues, socialise and network,
        2. private and public communication with like-minded individuals of same profession,
        3. allow people to communcate with impunity, (end-2-end encryption),
