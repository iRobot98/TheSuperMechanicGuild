Ideas:
    1. Sacco for storing and borrowing/lending money
        -> internal currency equivalent (Mechanicum coins)
        -> services:
            - periodic contribution
            - ledger and balance sheet
            - borrow money (Credit Rating Tracker)
                -> borrow anonymously, with the system acting as mediator
            - lending money (Personal Digital Wallet/Bank)
                -> lend anonymously, with the system acting as mediator
            - get paid for:
                1. offering decentralised hosting share,
                2. offering lending service (ie, lend cash through app and earn cash),
            - market for creating/tokenizing physical/financial assets and securitization into financial instruments to be traded on internal marketplace
    
    2. Blockchain/Crypto-network:
        - Public ID and Private ID:
            - Public ID:
                1. Anonymous tag/code-name with hash number username,
                2. Cash/Crypto transactions can be done directly to/through Anonymous/Public ID,
                3. Public ID can act as a pseudo legal identity - a legal body under "The SuperMechanic Guild",
                4. verified public personna without revealing the true identity of the anonymous holder,
            - Private ID:
                1. Personal ID, need a real/full legal identity, is verified and account is maintained by cash subscription,
                2. To join the Sacco:

                    - need a personal history of Mechanic work,
                    - progress tracking (completed projects),
                    - transact through the Public ID but cash is credited private ID,
                    - cash subscription,
                    - participate in group
                3. personal responsibility to maintain accountability (by the Sacco),
                4. real world agent/avatar for digital identity, or source/substance behind digital identity,
                5. the private identity is the individual who enjoys the benefits
