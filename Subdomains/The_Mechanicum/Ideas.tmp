Ideas:
    1. Communication platform for mechanics to exchange ideas:
        - since each account is a verified/paying individual user, bots and spam and troll account usage is identifiable/dealable,
        - open source code and open API means members contribute and effect changes at will, and flat-democracy ie all members have contribution capacity only capped by credibility to other members,
    2. Twitter-Facebook-Discord merge:
        - Twitter:
            1. public speaking space everyone has unmediated access to;
            2. short messages (500 chars), with comments, retweets, screenshots, reactions;
                - memes, pics, vids
            3. able to be shared offsite (ie digital history)
            4. verification and honour system,
        - Facebook/Meta:
            1. Personal blog, with limited access control, friendships and groups
            2. Personal email and comm routes, 
            3. personal ecommerce shop,
            4. digital-verse platform/connection,
            - Snapchat:
                1. real life ID,
                2. Digital anonymous subaccounts are available,
                3. video sharing platform,
        - Discord:
            1. form groups and servers, decentralised organisation,
            2. organise independently and supervise internally,
            3. bots and API for automation and integration/extension
    3. Reddit-Wiki-Slack merge:
        - general Wiki for collecting/agglomerating experience and knowledge:
            -> Gitting/History-tracker,
            - shows latest version, and version history/forking tree
            - University/Research grade info can be locked behind pay-wall, with credit instruments available,
        - Reddit honour system (by proving competence accrued by participation and contribution),
        - Citation system:
            - get honour points for Wiki contribution, ie upvotes and downvotes,
            - get honour points for referrals/recommendations by other members,
            - get honour points for project completions:
                - ie, buy/source/upload blueprints,
                - complete a project atleast once using the blueprint/ideas,
                - upload a verifiable format of the completed blueprint,
                - get honour points on:
                    1. speed of completion,
                    2. complexity of blueprint/project,
                    3. number of completed projects,
                    4. variations/improvements on project,
                    5. need at least 3 different members to act as underwriters/witnesses,
            - get honour points for citations (and citation inheritance to the 5th generation),
        - honour points are a licensing source-of-income:
            - share ideas, and when used in a copyrighted product, earn a small commision,
            - system acts as a licensing tracker,
    4. 'Job Site'-'National Assembly' merge:
        - [National] Guild Assembly:
            1. polling system, 
            2. idea-sharing system,
            3. 3-tier organisation:
                - tier 1: Presidential Board (and Cabinet),
                - tier 2: Guild Assembly (Chair, Speaker, Secretariat, Members/Representatives),
                - tier 3: Ministerait (department heads, secretrait, management, members),
            4: purpose of Guild Assembly:
                - Sacco members participate in electing boards/assemblies,
                - Sacco members propose and discuss issues (financial, legal, social, professional, etc) through the social network (Twitter aspect),
                - Guild Assembly makes/proposes/discusses laws/policies/procedures to implement,
                - After Guild Assembly and General Assembly agrees on final product/laws/policies/procedure, push to President/Executive to implement,
                - Executive Branch (President, Board, Ministerait), organises the implementaion of the agreed upon ideas,
                    - if under existing docket, restructures to execute,
                    - if need new docket, new docket is created,
                    - dockets are temporal; beginning date, role/goal, end date
                    - dockets are accountable; docket head answers to public/General Assembly for performance relative to goals, cyclic/periodic
                5. 3 arms, legislature, executive, and judicial system work on credibility and flat-democracy (roles are respected whilst individuals may change, and changing of rules/laws is procedural but open)
        - Job Site:
            - anyone can post job offers on an open market,
