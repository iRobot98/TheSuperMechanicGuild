Ideas:
    1. Open/Online University accessible to all Mechanicum members,
    
    2. Offers:
        - physical classes, by: [tutors, accredited universities, masters],
        - virtual classes,
        - prerecorded lectures and experiments and work walkthroughs,
        - certifications on different topics/fields/units,
        - both linear and open courses:
            - linear course follows current/standard units/syllabus,
            - open course allows student/member to freely pick units and study at pace,
    
    3. still requires minimum number of units/completion for each stage of Mechanic:
        1. Novice, (1 field of knowledge)
        2. Apprentice, (3 fields)
        3. Junior Journeyman, (5 fields)
        4. Senior Journeyman, (7 fields)
        5. Master, (2 apprentices graduate to Junior Journeyman)
