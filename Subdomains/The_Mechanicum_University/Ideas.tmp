Ideas:
    1. Open/Online University accessible to all Mechanicum members,
    
    2. Offers:
        - physical classes, by: [tutors, accredited universities, masters],
        - virtual classes,
        - prerecorded lectures and experiments and work walkthroughs,
        - certifications on different topics/fields/units,
        - both linear and open courses:
            - linear course follows current/standard units/syllabus,
            - open course allows student/member to freely pick units and study at pace,
    
    3. still requires minimum number of units/completion for each stage of Mechanic:
        1. Novice, 
            (1 field of knowledge/practice)
        2. Apprentice, 
            (3 fields)
        3. Junior Journeyman, - participate in professional knowledge/experience 
            (5 fields)
        4. Senior Journeyman, 
            (7 fields)
        5. Master, 
            (2 apprentices graduate to Junior Journeyman)
            -start contributing to class knowledge by developing new fields/domains
        6. Grand Master, 
            (5 apprentices at Senior Journeyman)
        7. Star-grade Grand Master, title - King Class Mechanic
            (min. production/supply to 5 star systems)
        8. Galaxy-grade Grand Master, title - Emperor Class Mechanic
            (min. production/supply to 5 galaxy systems)
        9. Universe-grade Grand Master, title - Lord Class Mechanic
            (min. production/supply to 5 galaxy-clusters)
            

    4. Reddit-Wiki-Slack merge:
        - general Wiki for collecting/agglomerating experience and knowledge:
            -> Gitting/History-tracker,
            - shows latest version, and version history/forking tree
            - University/Research grade info can be locked behind pay-wall, with credit instruments available,
        - Reddit honour system (by proving competence accrued by participation and contribution),
        - Citation system:
            - get honour points for Wiki contribution, ie upvotes and downvotes,
            - get honour points for referrals/recommendations by other members,
            - get honour points for project completions:
                - ie, buy/source/upload blueprints,
                - complete a project atleast once using the blueprint/ideas,
                - upload a verifiable format of the completed blueprint,
                - get honour points on:
                    1. speed of completion,
                    2. complexity of blueprint/project,
                    3. number of completed projects,
                    4. variations/improvements on project,
                    5. need at least 3 different members to act as underwriters/witnesses,
            - get honour points for citations (and citation inheritance to the 5th generation),
        - honour points are a licensing source-of-income:
            - share ideas, and when used in a copyrighted product, earn a small commision,
            - system acts as a licensing tracker,
